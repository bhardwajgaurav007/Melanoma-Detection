# Melanoma Detection Case Study
This case study is to create and train a CNN based deep learning model to accurately detect melanoma. There are different types of cancers where Melanoma is a type of cancer, if not detected early can be deadly. This cancer accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. The case study is to develop a solution that can evaluate images and and detect the presence of melanoma.

## Description
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion
